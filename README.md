The recommendation system is one of the best subfields of information retrieval approaches where the large datasets are used to make meaningful predictions. These recommendation systems have been widely used with two approaches named content based andcollaborative filtering algorithm. The proposed system makes use of both the approaches to provide the combined algorithm which takes the user query and creates the results as movies that are related. By using the user profile, the hybrid recommendation system combines both content based and collaborative filtering algorithms that predict the users interested movies. The movie dataset is divided into training and testing data sets where the recommendation model is applied on the testing set to find the predictions. As part of the Content based filtering the item features are taken to predict the items related to userâ€™s query. The item features that areconsidered for the proposed system are the movie genres and ratings. In collaborative filtering process, the system uses the cosine similarity metric to find the distance between one user to other users. This approach overcomes the problem of cold start by using content based approach and handling data sparsity by selecting features. By combining both the recommendation algorithms, an hybrid approach is generated which provides more accurate results. This hybrid recommendation system finally recommends the set of movies that are relevant to the users interest.
